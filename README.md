# heart-shaped-box
A lockbox with a musical key.

This was an ambitious project that I took on for my undergrad senior project in 2021 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic at the University of California, San Diego.
The idea was to create a box that would unlock through sound. The owner could hum, whistle, or sing a tune and the box would unlock itself.
I created the electronics circuit and code for a prototype.
The next stage was to develop a sound recognition algorithm that could listen to a tune and compare it to a saved "key", and would unlock if it could hear a match. I tried a few approaches, but I just could not get an algorithm that would work with enough precision for this box to be at all useful, so I ended up using the algorithm I did make for another project, Staraoke, which I did turn in as my senior project.
